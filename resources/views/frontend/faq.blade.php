							<h3>What is a personal loan?</h3>
							<p class="u-text-large">A personal loan is money you borrow for any kind of personal use such as paying off previous debt, credit card debt, investing in home improvements, taking a special vacation, or paying for an engagement ring or wedding expenses. Taking a personal loan can be a smart way to consolidate high-interest rate balances under one monthly rate. To repay the loan, you make monthly payments of principal plus interest.  A personal loan gives you the flexibility to make big purchases, then pay it off at a pace that makes sense for you.</p>
